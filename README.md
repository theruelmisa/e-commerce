### Project Description

**Swimcommerce** shows a list of products available for sale--which is all added using commerce.js. For now project only consists of the Product Page, Cart Page, Checkout Page. This is to practice using e-commerce related APIs (commerce.js to act as backend and stripe as a payment gateway), react, and material ui (for styling). Great for people who want to just worry about the Front End of an e-commerce platform. Of course, that can also be made easily nowadays.

## Author's Notes

- This is just an MVP--Minimum Viable Product. Current Version just includes the product page, cart, and checkout for now. Planning to include a Landing Page.

- Planning to add either framer motion or gsap into project.

- Needs improvement in overall design. BUT the goal of this project was to familiarize self with _Commerce.js, Material UI, and Stripe_. Basically, to familiarize myself with building a working e-commerce site.
